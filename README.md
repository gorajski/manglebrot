![Mangled Mandelbrot Set](/screenshot.png)

Plots variations on the Mandelbrot set, based on a pseudorandom seed for `z` in `f(z) = z^2 + c`.  In the standard definition, the Mandelbrot set is defined for the seed `z = 0`.  Hence the name "Manglebrot", which is intended to describe the warped Mandelbrot sets visualized here using pseudorandom seeds.

To run, clone the repo and navigate your browser to `src/index.html`.  Clicking in the browser will draw a different Mandelbrot variation based on a new seed.

Also plotted is a white square to indicate the complex value of the pseudorandom seed.
